### Explanation of the Code

1.  **`grpc.NewClient(...)`**: This is the core function that creates a connection to the gRPC server at `serverAddr`.
    *   `grpc.WithTransportCredentials(insecure.NewCredentials())` is used here for simplicity. It disables TLS encryption. **Never use this in production.** For a real-world application, you would configure TLS credentials here.
2.  **`defer conn.Close()`**: This is idiomatic Go. It ensures that the connection is properly closed when the `main` function finishes, releasing the resources.
3.  **`pb.NewGreeterClient(conn)`**: This function comes from the generated `greeter_grpc.pb.go` file. It takes the active connection (`conn`) and returns a `GreeterClient` instance, which is the client stub. This stub has methods that correspond to the RPCs defined in your `.proto` file (e.g., `SayHello`).
4.  **`context.WithTimeout(...)`**: All gRPC calls in Go should be made with a `context`. This allows you to control deadlines, timeouts, and cancellation. Here, we're saying the call should fail if it takes longer than one second.
5.  **`c.SayHello(ctx, ...)`**: This is the actual remote procedure call.
    *   The first argument is the `context`.
    *   The second argument is a pointer to the request message struct (`&pb.HelloRequest{...}`).
    *   It returns the response message (`HelloReply`) and an `error`.
6.  **`r.GetMessage()`**: The generated Go structs for your protobuf messages include helper methods like `Get...()` to access their fields safely.

### How to Run It

1.  Make sure your gRPC server is running.
2.  Update the `go_package` option in your `.proto` file and the `import` path in `client/main.go` to match your project's Go module name (from your `go.mod` file).
3.  Open a new terminal in your project root.
4.  Run `go mod tidy` to fetch the necessary dependencies.
5.  Run the client:
    ```bash
    go run client/main.go
    ```
